#The Sanctuary Changelog

Pre-Logs from before 2019
February 28
Created a Changelog as well as added fonts for the title: Sactuary. I've been wondering whether or not to add a "The" to Sactuary in the title. I've also added a horizontal navigator. color of the nav text changes to white when the mouse hovers over it. Currently, the colors for the site is Red, Dark Red, and White.

March 14
I've hadded a horizontal scrolling screen. It took me forever to figure out. After working with some people in the Otaku Dan, it all came to a head eventually.

March 23
Working on new colors for the site. Darker backgrounds with white base text. The main color is definitely red, but deciding on a better shade still. Also still working on home page design.

April 4
After a presentation to the class, put more focus on other tabs so that they would be completed with the week. Perfecting one page at a time is not ideal.

April 6
Really really sro foreign sites. May just go to an image for now. (October 11, 2021 edit: I'm not sure what I meant by this statement.)

April 9
Completed Art page with drawings and ArtOne and ArtTwo pages taht flip back and forth. I want to do more to this page.

April 15
After feedback, fixed links and made content in Games and Art pages closer together. Content is more often centered to the middle of the scren and doesn't get too far apart. Fixed Links hover so that they turn black instead of blue, as was previous.

April 23
Working to make the homepage more clearly describe the purpose of the site. I want to give the site more personality, but it's difficult since I don't really have a goal

April 30
Created and added Skill.png into the files but was unable to put it into the background of a div in the index page. Also made some media quieries for a mobile view.

May 2
Got rid of the add-ons to the numbers in the change-log and completed the site for class. Added a contact page, added some skills. Everything before class has to be checked in class again. Finished the Fight. Sierra 117: Master Chief over and out.
