#Zakami's ChangeLog

The Sanctuary is a website-journal meant primarily for myself and family members to see my progress and growth as well as the things I've been working on.

Feb 28th: I added a changelog as well as added fonts for the title: Sanctuary.

I've been thinking about whether or not I'll be adding a "The" to the Sanctuary.

Added a horizontal nav. Color of nav text changes to white when it hovers on.

Colors for site decided: Solid red, dark red, white.

March 13, 14: I've added a horizontal scrolling screen. It took forever to figure out. After working with some people in the Dan it all came to a head eventually.
Spaghetti, Upsetti.

March 23: Added scrolling in a way that was 1000 times easier than the way it looked. Sometimes the internet overcomplicates problems.

March 26, 27, 28: Working on new colour schemes for the site. Darker backgrounds with a white base text. The color of the site is definitely red, but deciding on a specific shade still. The home page is also still be worked on.

April 4: After presenting to class, put more focus on the other tabs so that they would be completed within the week. Perfecting one page at a time is not ideal.

April 6th: Really, really sro foreign sites. May just go to an image for now.

April 8th/9th: Completed Art page with drawings and ArtOne and ArtTwo pages that flip back and forth. I want to do more with the design on fonts, but that'll come a bit later.

April 13th, 14th, 15th: After feedback, fixed links and made content in Games and Art pages closer together. Content is more often centered to the middle of the screen and doesn't get too far apart. Fixed Links hover so that they turn black instead ofblue, as was previous.

April 23rd: Working on making the homepage more clear to describe what the site is for. Trying to give the site more "Personality" but finding it difficult to actually do what I'm trying to do.

April 30th: Created and added Skull.png into the files but was unable to put it into the background of a div on hte index page. Also made some media quieries so that it has a mobile view.

May 1, 2: Got rid the add-ons to the numbers in the change-log and completed the website. Added a contact page, added the skulls, added everything before class to have checked in class again.

The End: Finished the Fight. Sierra 117: Master Chief over and out.
